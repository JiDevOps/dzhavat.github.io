title: What to include in the next version of “CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet”?

My [“CSS Flexbox Cheatsheet”](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dzhavat.css-flexbox-cheatsheet) VS Code extension is slowly reaching 20k installs! I celebrated the [10k install]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url posts/2020-03-08-css-flexbox-cheatsheet-vscode-extension-hit-10k-installs %}) just four months ago. That is absolutely incredible! I’ve never imagined one of my extensions will appeal to so many people. Thanks to every one of them. ❤

Now with this new milestone just around the corner, I’m asking myself what is next? How can I make the extension even better and more useful?

I have a couple of ideas. One is to make the cheatsheet view more interactive. Instead of static images for each value, there can be buttons that will apply the selected value to a set of boxes and you’ll be able to see how it affects them.

Another idea is to redesign the current images. There’s nothing wrong with them, but they can probably be made easier to understand.

A third idea is to include links to different demos like how to center an item both horizontally and vertically, how to make a top bar that contains a logo and a menu aligned to the right, etc.

What do you think about these ideas? Do you have other ideas/suggestions for improvements? If you’ve used the extension, have you had a moment where you thought something could be made better?
